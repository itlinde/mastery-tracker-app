# ⭐️ About Mastery Tracker
A tracker to help students monitor understanding of a course’s material and focus study time on areas needing improvement.

# How it works
1. Create a new Subject (eg. Math 101)
2. Add a new topic (eg. integration by parts, partial fractions)
3. Create a timestamp:
   Select the date last reviewed, and assign a colour based on your level of understanding.\
   🍎 : I could not tell you anything about this topic\
   🍊 : I could tell you one or two things\
   🍋: Rusty\
   🍈 : Okay\
   🥝 : Solid Understanding\
   🥬 : Mastered
5. Keep adding new timestamps for each date reviewed and associated colour. Expand the "Last Reviewed" section to view your subject's study history!
